    "Date": "1830s\u20131840s",
    "Era": "Industrial Communication",
    "Medium": "Telegraph",
    "InteractionPsych": "The telegraph altered cognitive frameworks by decoupling communication from transportation. For the first time, thoughts and decisions could travel faster than people or goods, prompting new notions of instantaneity and remote presence.",
    "KnowledgeInfo": "It introduced the era of real-time information flow. News, financial data, and military commands moved globally, creating synchronized markets and international journalism. Information was stripped down into concise messages, reshaping how facts were prioritized and compressed.",
    "CulturePoliticsSociety": "The telegraph enabled colonial administration, global banking, and rapid diplomacy. Governments could assert power over vast territories more efficiently, and wars were waged with unprecedented coordination. It laid groundwork for modern geopolitics and media infrastructure.",
    "UnexpectedEffects": "It spawned misinformation, market manipulation, and surveillance. The compression of complex messages into telegrams also oversimplified nuance. As telegraph cables were laid globally, empires often used them to consolidate control, foreshadowing the role of infrastructure in digital imperialism.",

    "Era": "Voice Transmission",
    "Medium": "Telephone",
    "InteractionPsych": "The telephone reintroduced emotion and spontaneity to long-distance communication. It reshaped how people maintained relationships, allowing for real-time conversations rich with vocal nuance and intimacy.",
    "KnowledgeInfo": "It shifted knowledge from fixed to fluid. Unlike written or telegraphed messages, phone calls allowed for live negotiation, clarification, and decision-making, paving the way for verbal contracts and business globalization.",
    "CulturePoliticsSociety": "The telephone connected homes and workplaces, reshaping family life, gender roles, and business. It enabled instant alerts, strengthened social networks, and enhanced democratic responsiveness \u2014 yet also demanded constant availability.",
    "UnexpectedEffects": "The telephone enabled vertical architecture \u2014 elevators coordinated via voice allowed skyscrapers to flourish. It also triggered privacy concerns, as conversations became interceptable. Over time, expectations of accessibility and responsiveness intensified social pressure.",

    "InteractionPsych": "Radio created shared national and emotional experiences. Voices, music, and news reached millions at once, cultivating collective identity and ambient intimacy with remote speakers.",
    "KnowledgeInfo": "It brought live information to mass audiences, often bypassing printed intermediaries. Auditory learning gained legitimacy, and public discourse became more emotional and immediate.",
    "CulturePoliticsSociety": "Governments used radio to foster nationalism, wartime morale, and propaganda. Radio evangelism and talk shows reshaped spiritual and political communication. It knit nations together through common programming and rituals of listening.",
    "UnexpectedEffects": "Authoritarian regimes used radio for manipulation (e.g., Nazi Germany). It marginalized the visually impaired and created 'phantom communities' of listeners who felt connected but remained isolated. Radio also spurred new consumer desires through advertisements.",

    "KnowledgeInfo": "It shattered gatekeepers. Anyone could publish, access, remix, and distribute knowledge. But authority and truth became harder to verify, and algorithms began shaping what we see and know.",
